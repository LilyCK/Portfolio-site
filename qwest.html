              When creating Qwest’s wireframes, I used various design patterns.

            <p>
              For instance, I designed a search bar with autocomplete to help users search faster for a European city with hunts. I kept the suggestion list short so as to avoid overwhelming users, which was easy since not every city in Europe will
              have hunts. I also styled the entered and suggested terms differently in order to highlight their differences and made the suggested terms bolder to draw the users’ eyes to them since users already know what they have entered
              themselves.

              To most test participants it was not clear that the explanation for the search feature in the onboarding was being typed in the search bar. This was mostly due to the fact that I had not properly achieved the “typing” animation.
              However, this made me realised that my “original” animation was not just confusing but was also inconsistent with the rest of the onboarding which consisted of coach marks.

              I had not included any explanations for the “active hunt” button into the onboarding because I wanted to highlight only the two main features of the app - the search and customising features - but this turned out to be a mistake. Some
              test participants pointed out that there was no explanation for this button and none of them could figure out what it was for.

              My first solution to this problem was to redesign the onboarding so that the design was more consistent and included an explanation for the “Active hunt” button, which I also renamed “Ongoing hunt”. However, I was not very satisfied
              with this solution as I couldn’t ignore one of the test participants comment about how coach marks were not very useful, at least for the search bar and the “create hunt” button as both these elements were self-explanatory.

              Instead of using coach marks, I decided to design a slide-through onboarding which highlights the main features of the app like I wanted originally. With this design, I was also able to include the sign up/log in feature which I had
              forgotten to include in my previous designs. As for an explanation for the “Ongoing hunt” button, I used the empty state of the screen to explain its purpose to new users.

            I learnt a great deal whilst working on this app as this was my first UX project that I worked on as part Careerfoundry’s UX Design Course. I learnt how vital user research is as it helps place users at the centre of the project and
            provides the foundation for the initial design. In retrospect, I wish I had interviewed a few more people and taken the time to collect some quantitative data through a survey. This would have enabled me to support my interview findings
            on a larger sample. When it came to the design, getting feedback from my mentor and friends made me open and receptive to criticism. I actually enjoyed when I was being told that I should change something, improve my design in some way. I
            could say that the biggest lesson I learnt during this project was to not be too attached to a particular design as well as afraid to start over.
