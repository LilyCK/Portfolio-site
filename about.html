              <h2>My Story</h2>
              <p>Currently, I am finishing CareerFoundry’s UX Design course and working a full-time job in retail.</p>
              <p>Prior to this, I studied a bachelor in Law at the University of York which I thoroughly enjoyed, even though I nearly didn’t make it out alive. What drew me to Law was both the intellectual challenge of solving legal issues and the ability to help people. However, I later realised that the archaic and hierarchical way of working within a law firm was not at all suited for me.</p>
              <p>It was during my last year of university that I discovered UX Design and was immediately drawn to it. Design thinking is often described as a methodology of solving problems in order to improve the quality of life for people, exactly what I enjoyed about Law. However when we design, we bring about change - good and bad - and our responsibility, as designers, is to come up with a design that best addresses the issue in question, but which has the least negative impact on society. The work of a designer is more complex than what we make it out to be and that is why I am attracted to a career in UX Design.</p>
              <p>I feel that I am a great designer because I am three things: curious, creative and caring. Furthermore, I like to describe myself as collaborative as I really enjoy working within a team. I am also autonomous when I need to be. I have keen eye for detail thanks to my law degree. Lastly but not least, I enjoy and am quite good at putting myself in other people's shoes. Where I currently work, I advise soon-to-be parents on the kind of products that will fulfill their needs and fit their requirements. To be able to do this, I spent time talking to them to understand their situation and needs.</p>
              <p>In my spare time, I eat, travel, 'Marie Kondo’ my apartment and listen to true crime podcasts.<p>
